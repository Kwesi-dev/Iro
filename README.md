## Tools I Used

- **Vercel**
  Vercel is the platform for front-end developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.

- **Xata**
  Xata is a serverless database that comes with frictionless developer experience, a spreadsheet-like UI, and built-in search.

  I wanted to build a scalable and reliable platform that could handle many users and provide on-demand personalised astrological data and inspiration. To achieve this, I turned to Xata, a serverless database platform that offers many features, such as a Relational database, Branch & Migration, Powerful search and Fast analytics.

  Using Xata free tier allowed me to build Iro confidently, knowing that my platform could handle many users and provide personalised data and inspiration on demand. I recommend Xata to anyone looking to build a serverless, scalable, and reliable database platform for their application.
